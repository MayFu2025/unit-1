# Reflection: 2023/10/23
### What worked well?
I feel proud of myself and what I made, considering less than half a year ago I had absolutely no idea how to code in python (or any other language really). I actively tried to solve any issues I encountered myself, but also didn't hesitate to reach out for help when I got really stuck. I think this helped me challenge myself to learn on my own but also learn from my seniors and peeers with more experience.

### What did not work well?
I think that I could've managed my time better (as I need to with every other subject as well). I spent a lot of time in the last 3 days before the project was due trying to finish up everything, and the whole documentation process. While I got it done, I still think that I could've done better if I had finished coding earlier and documented without the time rush. Especially considering that this was the first unit and we're not so familiar with how to document, it would've been a lot nicer and saved me time to fix up my code more, had I gotten to this point earlier.

### What is your goal for unit 2?
My goal for unit 2 is to code more complex functions for my projects. Looking at what others had made in the last unit, I feel as though I could've done more and challenged myself further. While my main goal was (and will continue to be) to meet the success criteria, I think that I could've set something more challenging for myself, or I could've gone beyond the success criteria.

### How do you plan on achieving that goal?
The first thing would be to work on my project in a more time efficient manner: It would've helped if I had finished coding the product earlier to leave time for documentation, and have extra time for adding more and fixing bugs. I can also try to select success criterias that are realistic for me to achieve but also challenging and requires me to go beyond just what we learned in class.
